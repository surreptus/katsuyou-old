ðŸ’® Katsuyou
---

Katsuyou (Japanese for conjugation) is a tool to help learn about and conjugate
different verbs in context. It is built using `create-react-app` and should
have all the regular commands that come with it.

## Commands
- `yarn start` runs the development server and opens up the applicaiton in
  a brower tab.
- `yarn lessons` creates the lessons by fetching common verbs from `jisho`,
  conjugates then and then finds sentences for them.

## Feedback
Please feel free to open up an issue with any problems that you see with the
tool or open up a PR.
